**ShramSetu** is a digital platform that connects daily wage workers — such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, masons, and painters — with local employers who need their services.  
It acts as a bridge (“Setu”) between **employers** and **workers**, enabling job postings, discovery, and hiring in a simple and transparent way.
